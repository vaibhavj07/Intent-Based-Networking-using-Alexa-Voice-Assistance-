# Intent-Based-Networking-using-Alexa-Voice-Assistance-

Using Intent-Based Networking and Alexa Voice Recognition, the process of executing network-based operations 
that would have been performed manually has been automated, saving time and effort and reducing human error. 

This project was performed on Ubuntu 20.0 on a virtual and might need some changes to run on other versions. 

The instructions on how to run this project CLI has been provided in Execution Instruction file. 

To use Alexa, an Alexa developer account has to be created with appropriate intents and the Alexa.py should be hosted locally using Ngrok.
